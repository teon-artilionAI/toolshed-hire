# Toolshed Hire backend

FastAPI and PostgreSQL. This directory is the walking skeleton, which means it
proves the load bearing decisions end to end and nothing else. It is not a
first pass at the whole application.

## What it proves

1. A migration creates the seventeen tables of the documented schema in real
   PostgreSQL, with the `btree_gist`, `citext` and `pg_trgm` extensions, and a
   test reads the catalogue to confirm that what was built is what was
   designed.
2. A `daterange` GiST exclusion constraint rejects an overlapping allocation of
   the same physical asset.
3. Two genuinely concurrent transactions cannot double book one unit, because
   candidates are locked with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and the
   constraint has the last word.
4. A React client can call a role protected endpoint and get a correct answer.
5. A constraint violation surfaces as a clean HTTP 409, never a 500.

## Layout

| Path | Layer | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `app/domain` | Domain | `BookingPeriod`, enumerations, errors. No database access. |
| `app/application` | Application | Use cases and transaction boundaries. |
| `app/infrastructure` | Infrastructure | Engine, SQLModel tables, hashing, tokens. |
| `app/infrastructure/models` | Infrastructure | One SQLModel class per table, one module per subject area. |
| `app/api` | API | Routers, dependencies, problem responses. |
| `alembic/versions` | Migrations | Hand written, because autogenerate cannot invent an exclusion constraint. |
| `alembic/baseline` | Migrations | The frozen definitions behind migration `0001`, one module per subject area. |

## The schema

Migration `0001` is the baseline. It creates seventeen tables with singular
snake_case names, which are the sixteen domain tables and `rate_limit_counter`.

| Subject area | Tables |
|---|---|
| Identity and access | `branch`, `user_account`, `customer_profile`, `refresh_session` |
| Catalogue and fleet | `category`, `product_model`, `asset` |
| Booking and allocation | `reservation`, `reservation_line`, `asset_allocation` |
| Hire and money | `rental`, `rental_item`, `damage_report`, `charge` |
| Evidence and supporting | `audit_event`, `notification`, `rate_limit_counter` |

The same five subject areas name the modules in `app/infrastructure/models`
and in `alembic/baseline`. The two are kept apart on purpose. The models change
as the application grows. The baseline is a snapshot that imports nothing from
`app`, so an edit to a model can never change what an already released
migration creates. A later change to the schema is a new revision.

The migration is the one authoritative listing of the check constraints, the
exclusion constraint and the indexes. The models declare columns and keys and
do not repeat them.

## Running it locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate          # PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env            # then edit DATABASE_URL

alembic upgrade head
python seed.py
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

`GET http://localhost:8000/api/health` should report
`{"status": "healthy", "databaseReachable": true, "btreeGistInstalled": true}`.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Roles admitted |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/health` | Public by declaration, for the uptime check. |
| POST | `/api/auth/sign-in` | Public, it issues the credential. |
| GET | `/api/me` | Any active account. |
| POST | `/api/allocations` | Any active account. A customer may only book for themselves. |

Every other endpoint added later must declare its roles. The default is deny
(BR-41).

## The constraint

```sql
ALTER TABLE asset_allocation
ADD CONSTRAINT asset_allocation_no_overlap
EXCLUDE USING gist (
    asset_id WITH =,
    daterange(start_date, end_date, '[)') WITH &&
) WHERE (released_at IS NULL);
```

Periods are half open. A return on the twelfth frees the twelfth. The same rule
is implemented once in the domain, in `BookingPeriod`, and once in the
database, here. The two must never drift apart.

An allocation is active exactly while `released_at` is null. Releasing one
stamps `released_at` and `release_reason` together, which a check constraint
enforces, and the row drops out of the constraint without being deleted.

A violation arrives as SQLSTATE `23P01`. The allocation use case matches on the
code and the constraint name reported in the driver diagnostics, never on the
error message text, and raises `AssetUnavailableConflict`, which the API maps
to a 409 problem document.

## Configuration

Every value comes from the environment. See `.env.example`. Outside
development and test the process refuses to start while `JWT_SECRET` is still
the placeholder or `DATABASE_URL` still points at localhost, because a
deployment that boots on a known secret is a hole nobody notices.

## Checks

I run these from this directory before I publish a change. The pipeline runs
the same commands.

```bash
ruff check .                     # lint, including S608 and C901 at complexity 10
mypy app                         # strict type check
lint-imports                     # the layer contract
pytest tests -m "not postgres"   # unit, component and API tests, no database
pip-audit                        # known vulnerabilities in the installed packages
```

`lint-imports` reads its contracts from `pyproject.toml`. It fails when
`app.domain` imports `app.application`, `app.infrastructure` or `app.api`, and
when `app.application` or `app.infrastructure` imports `app.api`. It does not
yet stop `app.application` importing `app.infrastructure`. I tighten that
contract when the repositories land.

The full run needs a real PostgreSQL 16. I start the one described by
`docker-compose.yml` at the repository root, which holds a single disposable
database called `toolshed_test`, and I stop it afterwards.

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait

ENVIRONMENT=test DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://toolshed:toolshed_local_only@localhost:5432/toolshed_test \
  pytest tests --cov --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml

docker compose stop
```

That run is the only one gated on coverage. It measures `app/domain` and
`app/application` and fails below 70 percent. The run without PostgreSQL
carries no `--cov` flag, so it is never held to the threshold. The password in
the compose file is a local throwaway and the port is bound to 127.0.0.1. I set
`TOOLSHED_DB_PORT` when 5432 is already taken.

## Tests

The suite is split in two by the `postgres` marker, and the pipeline runs the
two halves as separate jobs.

```bash
pytest tests -m "not postgres"   # unit, component and API tests, no database
pytest tests -m postgres         # the schema, the exclusion constraint and concurrency
```

Everything without the marker runs against an in memory SQLite engine and must
never open a network connection. The marked tests need a real PostgreSQL 16
reached through `DATABASE_URL`, because the things they prove, `btree_gist`, a
`daterange` exclusion constraint and two genuinely concurrent transactions, have
no SQLite equivalent. With `DATABASE_URL` unset they skip with a message saying
what to set rather than failing.

The marked tests migrate the database to head themselves and truncate every
table between cases, so point them at a database you are willing to lose. They
refuse to run at all unless `ENVIRONMENT` is `development` or `test`.

`tests/integration/test_schema_baseline.py` runs before every other test. It
reads the PostgreSQL catalogue and asserts that the three extensions, the
seventeen tables, the seventeen enumerated types, the exclusion constraint with
its exact definition and the partial indexes all exist. Every other integration
test assumes that schema, so a broken migration is reported once at the top
instead of as a page of unrelated failures. The order is set by the collection
hook in `tests/integration/conftest.py`, which needs no plugin.

### The postgres suite and your seed data cannot share a database

`pytest -m postgres` truncates every table in the schema before and after each
test case. It is not selective, and it does not restore anything afterwards. If
`DATABASE_URL` points at the database you ran `python seed.py` against, the
branches, the catalogue, the assets and the three accounts are gone the moment
the suite runs, and the next sign in from the running application fails with
credentials that were correct five minutes earlier. That has already happened
twice. It is not a bug in the tests. Emptying the tables is what makes a
concurrency test repeatable.

Use two databases. One holds seed data and serves the application, the other is
disposable and belongs to the suite.

```bash
# The seeded one, which serves the running application.
docker run --name tsh-pg -e POSTGRES_USER=toolshed -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=toolshed \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=toolshed -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:16

# The disposable one, from docker-compose.yml at the repository root. I move it
# to 5433 here because the seeded database already holds 5432.
TOOLSHED_DB_PORT=5433 docker compose up -d --wait

# The suite. Note the port and the database name, and note that it is not the
# seeded one.
ENVIRONMENT=test DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://toolshed:toolshed_local_only@localhost:5433/toolshed_test \
  pytest tests -m postgres
```

If the seed does disappear, `python seed.py` puts it back. The script is
idempotent and matches on natural keys, so running it again costs nothing.
